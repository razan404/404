### Project Description
Our tool takes the guesswork out of fashion by using color science to analyze your wardrobe. Simply select a shirt and pant combo, and we’ll provide a real-time match percentage to tell you exactly how well they go together.

### The Problem statement
Visual Indecision-that frustrating moment when someone stands in front of a mirror and can’t tell if their outfit is a "look" or a mistake.

### The Solution
Instead of physically putting on clothes and standing in front of a mirror, users can experiment virtually. By allowing users to toggle colors for shirts and pants instantly, you provide a low-stakes environment to test "risky" combinations without the mess.
